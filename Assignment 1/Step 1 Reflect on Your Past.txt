Step 1: Reflect on Your Past
-Truely happy: The Halloween Haunt at Canada's Wonderland in October 2021. I don't belive I was on the pill at the time, and Dad wasn't there to begin with so I was able to get in the mood of being more esentric (though our relationship is much better now). It was important because this was a social setting and I felt very natural. I was able to feel like I was entertaining without forcing it.
-Truely happy: The Raptors game for work in December 2022. I know for sure I wasn't on the pill
-Proud: I've always felt the most proud when I'm singing. Back in grade 9 singing "7 Years" and hearing one of my teachers and others whoop, getting chosen for fan covers over and over and trying to get a better qualoity each time, hearing the praise from my parents, peers, music teacher, an audience. And I feel proud because I do feel like I put in the effort, that I did genuinely try to do good, and not use the talent I had at the time to scrap something together.
-Proud: 
-Upset: In grade 11, I was in a musical theater class and there were about 3 or 4 sections we were ultimately split into; actors, prop designers, technicians, and backstage crew. We were told we could only be in one, but I was set as both a light's operator (technician) and a side actor, and maybe as a prop designer (I don't quite remember if I was assigned that or I wormed my way in). You would think this would be seen as a good thing, being believed that you can do 2 sections, but I didn't see it like that. It didn't feel like viewed as being capable of doing two different sections, it felt like I was viewed as not good enough to do either meaningfully, felt like I was viewed was inconsiquencial, incompetent, and could just be filled wherever as an afterthought. I was told I was a light's operator because I was one of two people in the whole school who knew how to operate the lights at the time, but I really didn't absorb anything aobut the lights the year prior, and by trying to teach a new guy about the lights, I fricking deleted all the set programming for the lights. So I was definitely not focused on lights anymore and instead looked to props, as they needed help. So slowly and surely, though basically forcfully giving myself more and more tasks, I basically became the lead props manager. I designed the 3 triangle backdrops (with help), build many cardboard props (as I've done before) and when it we got volunteers to complete the work on time, they kinda reported to me. However, dispite me quite literally managing all the props, I was never OFFICALLY the props director, so eventually the teacher derailed the plans I had and most of my duties were null. I was just noted as a prop helper, like the volunteers. Top of the helper list, sure, but all I was seen was as a helper.








What Beliefs do I hold to be true? 


What things do I truely value?
1. Compitency: I respect those who think compitently. Either you're compitent with your work or you know you're limitations and work around them intelligently as to not hamper others
2. 
3. 




As a sidenote, I would apreciate it if you didn't make me have an exisential crisis as my first assignment, maybe leave it like, the 4 assignment when the sunk-cost falacy has kicked in.
